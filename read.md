# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains transaction details, including time, amount, and anonymized features.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics analysis

## Installation

To run this notebook, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

##Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains anonymized credit card transaction records, with labels indicating fraudulent or non-fraudulent transactions.

##Machine Learning Models
The notebook experiments with different models, such as:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Neural Networks
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC-AUC Curve
Results
The model with the best performance is selected based on precision-recall trade-offs to minimize false positives and false negatives.

##Contributing
